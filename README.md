## Published Front End version Alpha Contributions

Buruk: Made initial github repository with some tailwind additions <br> <br>
Cai: Made the Figma prototype for our application, focused on comparing media and based off of hardware comparison websites. <br> <br>
Victor: Look over materials <br> <br>
Brittney: Had meetings with Cai and Buruk over some design stuff.
Did spend some time looking over web api credentials because last week seemed to give us some trouble rushing to
get it in and wanted to make sure things would be working okay for the team who uses our work. <br> <br>
Abdullahi: Tested and confirmed the Credentials API works (register, login, JWT, password, email). <br> <br>
